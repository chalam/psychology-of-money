Money is a funny thing. We think we own it and that we control it. But emotionally-driven behavious that manifest themselves in how we interact with our finances can end up controlling us.

You may think that you are an above average investor, as you constantly have good ideas for new trades. The truth, however, could be that you have developed the thinking patterns of a gambling addict, and may have taken up risky habits such as day trading or spread betting in pursuit of a psychological high.

In contrast, you could see yourself as an exceedingly generous spouse or parent, when in fact you are over-spending to a dangerous degree to prop up faltering self-esteem or even fuel narcissism.

Do you have a spending, saving or investing style that is truly serving you? Or one that is psychologically unhealthy?

<h2 class="o-typography-subhead">Take our quiz to get an idea of where you are</h2>

Designed in consultation with UCL professor of psychology Adrian Furnham and several other leading academics who study investment and consumption, the test will reveal whether you have a strong, dominant financial personality type.

**TKTK update with more accurate quiz instructions TKTK** Mr Furnham has designed 18 statements. Use the tool to rate yourself according to how strongly you agree that they describe you. It will then reveal how you score against any of the six financial behaviour categories our experts have come up with. Low or medium scores across several types suggests you have a healthy seperation between money and emotion. A very strong score in any particular category could suggest it is time to re-examine your relationship with your finances.

So letâ€™s see how you do.
